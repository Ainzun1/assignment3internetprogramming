For this assignment I had to develop a dynamic webpage with javascripts, signup form, and display data from the database.
I hosted this webpage at https://aaiassignment.000webhostapp.com/. 
The sign up form also had to have data validation options.

In the files you will see the code for the index, css, and javascript that I used to create this website.
In the Wiki I provide details and examples of my process with creating this website.
